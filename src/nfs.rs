/// will manage many of the low-level details like inode numbers, offsets, sizes,
/// and lazy persistence.
///
/// In doing so, implementing a backend store for `NetFuse` (ie. implementing `NetworkFilesystem`)
/// is mostly a matter of making network network calls that map to very common filesystem operations.
